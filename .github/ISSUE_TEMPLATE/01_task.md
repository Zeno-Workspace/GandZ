## Task Description

A clear and concise description of the task or feature to be implemented.

## Background/Context

Why is this task needed? What problem does it solve or what improvement does it provide?

## Acceptance Criteria
<!--
What must be true for this task to be considered complete.
Write specific, testable outcomes. Prefer observable behavior over implementation details.
You can use either a checklist of outcomes or Given/When/Then scenarios.
-->

- [ ] Given <precondition>, when <action>, then <observable result>
- [ ] <User-visible behavior or UI state is correct and matches spec/mockup link>
- [ ] <Performance target met: e.g., >= X FPS in scene Y on device Z with settings S>
- [ ] <Integration works: ResourceManager handles new assets without leaks; logs/metrics emitted>
- [ ] <No regressions in existing scenes/features; automated or manual verification noted>

<details>
<summary>Examples</summary>

Example for a rendering toggle:
- [ ] Given "Shadow Quality" is set to High, when rendering Scene A at 1080p on RTX 3060, then average FPS >= 60 and shadow map resolution is 2048.
- [ ] UI/HUD displays the current setting and persists it across app restarts.
- [ ] ResourceManager loads/unloads shadow resources without increasing peak RSS by more than 50MB after unload.
- [ ] Visual output differences vs baseline are limited to shadows; non-shadow pixels change < 1%.
- [ ] Desktop Chrome/Firefox/Safari show identical behavior; no console errors.

Example for a new material:
- [ ] PBR material renders within Delta E <= 2 vs reference for gold, plastic, and fabric samples.
- [ ] Material parameters are editable at runtime; changes reflect within one frame.
- [ ] ES module loads without blocking main thread > 50ms; network waterfall shows <= 2 additional requests.

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Impact
- [ ] CONFIG changes required
- [ ] New module/class needed
- [ ] ResourceManager integration
- [ ] Performance monitoring integration
- [ ] Post-processing effects
- [ ] Shader modifications

### Visual/Animation Requirements
- [ ] Layer modifications
- [ ] Animation parameter changes
- [ ] Material/lighting updates
- [ ] UI/HUD changes

## Implementation Notes

- Any specific technical considerations
- Dependencies or prerequisites
- Potential performance implications
- Browser compatibility concerns

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Desktop testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Mobile testing
- [ ] Performance validation (FPS, render calls, triangles)
- [ ] Visual regression testing
- [ ] ES module loading verification

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Feature implemented and tested
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance impact measured and acceptable
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] ResourceManager properly handles new resources
